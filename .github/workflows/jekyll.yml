# Sample workflow for building and deploying a Jekyll site to GitHub Pages
name: Deploy Jekyll site to Pages

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:
    branches: ["master"]

  # Run visual tests on pull requests to master
  pull_request:
    branches: ["master"]

# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
