# Website Refactor

## Overview

- I want to refactor my website while preserving the same look and feel as exactly as I can.
- I want to use proper HTML semantic markup.
- I want to use modern CSS.
- I want to have zero reliance on frameworks like the old Bootstrap framework that is still here.
- Besides the Google Analytics include, I want no JavaScript.
- I want to still to what will work for Jekyll and GitHub Pages.
- I want to use modern web standards, and if it makes sense look at Shadow DOM,
  if that will help componentize and modularize the site.
- I want to think about page weight and deliver items to the browser as efficiently as possible.
- I already added Playwright tests as a harness in advance of this refactor to give us a test loop.
- Rob Eisenberg inspired me with his philosophy on modern web and needing very little footprint.
- I really want to focus on accessibility and ARIA, and if there are tests we can add for this that is great.
- I want to have all the proper meta tags that I should have in the header.
