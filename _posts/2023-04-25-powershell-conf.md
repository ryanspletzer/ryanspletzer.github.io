This week I am at a conference I've admired from afar but have not yet had the chance to go to, until now: the
[PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit](https://powershellsummit.org/).

If you've talked to me at any point, you know that PowerShell is a really important language and ecosystem for me,
and was a real launching point in my career.

Back in 2014 I was just a young shaver at my first job doing SharePoint development in C# -- which was the _hippest_,
_coolest_ type of development a young software engineer could ask to do, especially in the era where mobile apps were
exploding. :) But I digress.

I quickly learned that SharePoint server begets SQL server which also begets learning about Active Directory, which is
connected to Exchange, which is connected to Office 365 and Azure AD, and that you make Azure subscriptions to run
things to automate all these things -- it's all connected!

And how do you manage and automate all these things without an excrutiating click-next experience? PowerShell.

I realized pretty quickly that in order to be successful and go beyond the rudimentary GUI approaches of the time, and,
to be frank, in order to _do the right thing_, I was going to need to get really good at PowerShell, and automation in
general. (Mouse clicks don't scale.)
