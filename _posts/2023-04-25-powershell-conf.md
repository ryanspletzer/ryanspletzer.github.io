This week I am at a conference I've admired from afar but have not yet had the chance to go to, until now:

The [PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit](https://powershellsummit.org/).

If you've talked to me at any point, you likely know that PowerShell is a really important language and ecosystem for
me, and was a real inflection point in my career.

Back in 2014 I was at my first job doing SharePoint Server development in C# -- which was the _hippest_, _coolest_ type
of development a young software engineer could ask to do, especially in the era where mobile apps were exploding. :) But
I digress.

I quickly learned that SharePoint Server begets SQL Server which also begets learning about Active Directory, which is
connected to Exchange Online, which is connected to Office 365 and Azure AD, and Azure subscriptions and resources can
help to run to automate all these things -- it's all connected!

And how do you manage and automate all these things without an excrutiating click-next experience?

PowerShell.

At my next role I moved into working on R&D applications and the hosting environments CI/CD around them, and I realized
pretty quickly that in order to be successful and go beyond the rudimentary GUI approaches of the time (and, to be
frank, in order to _do the right thing_), I was going to need to get really good at PowerShell, and automation in
general. (Mouse clicks don't scale.)

I remember early on watching the Microsoft Virtual Academy courses from Jason Helmick and Jeffrey Snover:

* [Getting Started with PowerShell 3.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/getstartedpowershell3/)
* [Advanced Tools & Scripting with PowerShell 3.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/advpowershell3/)
* [Getting Started with PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/getting-started-with-powershell-dsc/)
* [Advanced PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) and Custom Resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/advanced-powershell-dsc-and-custom-resources/)

These courses and PowerShell in general changed my life and the trajectory of my career in ways that are difficult to
fully appreciate. I started asking questions like: "why can't we automate the setup of that server? Why can't we script
out the creation of those cloud resources?" And more. These are things we take for granted today, but were
game-changing at the time. Azure and AWS were much more nascent than they are today, and everyone was trying to wrap
their heads around this new earth-shattering concepts called "DevOps."
