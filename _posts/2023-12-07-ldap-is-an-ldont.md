Unless you enjoy cybersecurity punches to the face, you need to be evicting LDAP from your environment. Now.

Active Directory is a technology first introduced in 1999 and it shows.

Back then we were worried about such quaint things like Y2K and where to buy the latest 98 Degrees album, but much like
our music choices over time, *things need to change*.

At the time of this writing Active Directory is 24 years old, and it's not a healthy 24 years, it's an angsty,
security hole-ridden 24 year old that will crash on your couch and never leave.

But it needs to, because it's destroying your company from the inside out.
