I've recently discovered a very excellent productivity tool for priority tracking.

When I say I've tried everything to keep track of what I'm doing at work, I mean it:

- Table in Confluence
- Different structures in OneNote
- Personal Jira kanban boards
- And more...

What I've found happens with these tools is you put in a lot of up front work to get the structure in place, with
various properties and columns, etc., and then you're happy with it.

For a little while.

Then it degrades.

Suddenly all that detail you painstakingly poured into that new-tool-to-rule-them-all isn't so up-to-date anymore.

And then you realize it's not scaling for yourself.

And then you're sad.

I've found something that's been working a lot better than this lately:

The humble text file, saved on my desktop.

I simply have a heading in it called "Priorities" with bulleted items underneath, and two other headings called "Done"
and "Tabled", with dash-based bullet items underneath

Something new comes in? Add it to "Priorities." (Maybe put a star / asterisk next to current thing you're doing.)

Finish something? Move it to "Done."

Something isn't relevant anymore? Move it to "Tabled."

The line-oriented and simple, constrained nature of the humble text file does something interesting: it forces me to not
over-complicate something as basic as keeping track of what I'm doing.

As an added bonus, keeping it on my desktop keeps it within a very short reach helps me load it up semi-instantly
without worrying about waiting for a heavier program like OneNote, or the browser where I have to subsequently navigate
to a web page -- on top of simplicity, time-to-first-edit is another key aspect to ensuring your priority tracking stays
viable and can scale during hectic and busy time periods.

With a sea of productivity tracking tools out there, there is definitely no "one size fits all," but I would challenge
you to think through if your tracking is as simple as it can be, and ensure that your methodology and tools are working
_for_ you, rather that you working for the tool.
