Time and attention and energy are utterly precious and fleeting resources.

Following that, there are few things you can do that are more egregiously and flagrantly detrimental to a colleague's
time, attention, and energy than DM-ing them with a simple "Hi" or "Hello" with no context, and expecting a response
from that alone, towards something you are seeking to accomplish.

Imagine sending an email that just said "Hi" -- that would make absolutely no sense.

This lapse in etiquette, and delay in getting to the point, is extremely wasteful -- but don't just take my word for it,
[ask the internet](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-answer-when-someone-just-says-hi-but-nothing-after).

Hell hath no fury like a person DM'ed without context, which is why I have the following personal policy:

If you DM me with a simple greeting like "Hi Ryan" and nothing else, I will not reply to your message...

... until years from now...

... on my last day of work...

... when I will reply back with:

"Hi"
