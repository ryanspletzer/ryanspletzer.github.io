I am a big enthusiast when it comes to personal knowledge management, and I have found that over the years I need to
occasionally change my strategies in this space as my life and the nature of my work changes.

One of the books that strongly resonated with me is David Allen's [Getting Things Done](), and although it had some
dated references to the era of pen and paper work, and folders and bins for organizing things, I was generally able to
adapt the thought process to digital tools.

My digital tool of choice when it comes to organizing knowledge is Microsoft OneNote, and has been for well over a
decade; while other options are out there (and I have tried them -- hello, Evernote), I have found OneNote to be one
of the most versatile and useful tools in this space.

Of course, OneNote is not the only tool in my arsenal for being organized -- I also have my calendar, tasks and
reminders systems like most folks, and cloud drives like OneDrive of Google Drive, and more, but for purposes of this
post I'm focusing more on how I store and work with knowledge in notes to get things done, and I have notebooks for both
personal and work purposes.

Adapting David Allen's approach from Getting Things Done into the categories of Action, Incubation, and Reference I
believe worked well for me, for a time, but I always found that Action was under-utilized (save for my frequented
Groceries list) especially compared to task and todo-type applications, and Incubation was full of things that I might
get to "some day", and the Reference category was by far the most utilized.

The lack of suitability of certain categories, coupled with new demands in work where I have a lot of information flying
at me on a daily basis, led me to want to rethink the way I do this; coincidentally, I stumbled upon a book that
provided a new take on this type of organization that I think is more well-suited to modern day digital tools.

Recently I started reading Tiago Forte's [Building a Second Brain](), which outlines the PARA method of organizing
things into these categories:

* Projects
* Areas
* Resources
* Archives.

I will not go into great depth of what that book covers (do read it, it is worthwhile and goes beyond), but briefly (describe para)

LLMs

Of course, I am always looking for new ways to do things and improve, so if anyone has any approaches for how they
tackle the area of personal knowledge management, I am all ears.
