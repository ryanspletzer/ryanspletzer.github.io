Looking back on my technical career, one thing I've realized that has helped to propel me forward is that I tend to
lean into learning the "weird" stuff.

What do I mean by "weird"? You can view "weird" in this context as  synonym for "esoteric."

The weird stuff often has a lot of value -- in fact, the weird stuff I tend to lean into is the stuff that very few
people in the organization (if anyone) currently understands, but that regularly trips people up or even is a blocker
for teams to succeed.

As a technical leader, knowing the weird stuff helps me unblock myself, my team, and other teams at my company on a
regular basis.

By the way -- some weird stuff is company specific. The combinatorial mathematics of a company's selection of tools,
processes, and in-house systems create new cross-sections of "weird" that are uniquely yours to learn in that
organization.

I started my career as a SharePoint developer -- talk about one of the weirder things to learn starting fresh out of
college.

Amplifying your understanding and building it into reusable approaches and platforms helps to propagate best practices
around the weird stuff, and institutionalize and codify your own learning, helping to improve the organization.
