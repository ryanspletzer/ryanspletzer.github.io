The year was 2013. I was less than one year into my first job, and Google had just released
[Google Glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass).

This was no ordinary product release. In order to get your hands on this elusive new piece of technology, you needed to
enter the "Glass Explorer" program, and fork out a cash buy-in to get in on the beta.

I wound up acquiring this device through that program, and it resulted in about two weeks of novelty and looking like a
total dork, and the inception of a [colorful term](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/30095/glasshole).

Fast forward to the year 2023, and Google Glass in all its variations is now discontinued. I still have my device in a
drawer somewhere to show to future generations. Maybe it will make the rounds at _Antiques Roadshow_ one day.

The warnings signs were there: you only need talk to some veteran technologists in the industry and they will be quick
to enlighten you with tales regarding [VRML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRML) and other early attempts at VR, AR and
overall XR (extended reality).

It's one thing for a software product to be discontinued, since the barrier to entry is often low, and the barrier to
exit is usually similarly low. But the experience of a hardware product being discontinued, especially one you paid
money for, tends to stick with you more.

While I feel XR will have very viable real-world applications in the future (beyond gaming), the broader point and
lesson that I carry with me from being an early adopter of it and other emergent technologies is this: retain a healthy
skepticism.

Recent rise and falls of cryptocurrencies and exchanges, web3, NFTs, the metaverse hype and
[more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX), coupled with a current economic slowdown, are teaching us all a new round
of healthy skepticism lessons. And that's just about things that actually exist -- it turns out, some things
[don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos).

Then there is a whole other realm of technologies that were potentially ground-breaking, but just ahead of their time.
People forget about [Ping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes_Ping), the "social network for music," from Apple. If
you look at Spotify today, it fills much of that niche. Remember
[Google Wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Wave)? Meet Notion, and its competitors like Microsoft Loop.
There is a laundry list of these that I won't go into, but instead will ask the reader to prompt ChatGPT: "What's a
list of software and hardware technologies that are now dead but were ahead of their time?"

Speaking of ChatGPT: this appears to be a game-changing technology that's making us all forget about the web3 delirium
of the last few years. But, it remains to be seen whether it, too, will someday become pass√© and so built into
everything we use that we take it for granted, or whether we'll become "saturated" by a deluge of AI-generated things
that people wind up losing their taste for them. Microsoft is integrating AI assistance into Office now in the ultimate
realization of the original intentions of Clippy, but how many people will wind up creating the same-feeling artifacts
with these types of tools to the point where we yearn for something a little bit more human again?

Despite that, it is still our job as technologists to take that healthy skepticism forward and perform technical
exploration. The [decentralized identity](https://identity.foundation/) standards and verifiable credentials
technologies hold a lot of promise, some of which is starting to come to
[fruition](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedins-new-verification-features-include-clear-entra-rodriguez), and while
I personally believe these standards will play some part in our collective futures, it's still early days.

I've gotten burned in the past, but no question about it,
