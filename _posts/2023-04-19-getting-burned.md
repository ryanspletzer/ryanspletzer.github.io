The year was 2013, I was less than one year into my first post-college job, and Google had just released
[Google Glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass).

This was no ordinary product release -- in order to get your hands on this elusive new piece of technology, you needed
to enter the "Glass Explorer" program, and fork out a cash buy-in to get in on the beta.

I wound up acquiring this device through that program, and it resulted in about two weeks of novelty and looking like
a total dork, and the inception of a [colorful term](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/30095/glasshole) to describe
folks that went in on this.

Fast forward to the year 2023, and Google Glass in all its variations is now discontinued. I still have it in a drawer
somewhere to show to future generations. Maybe it will make the rounds at _Antiques Roadshow_ one day.

We should have seen the warnings signs: you only need talk to some veteran technologists in the industry and they will
be quick to enlighten you about tales regarding [VRML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRML) and other early attempts at
VR, AR and overall XR.

This story is ultimately not about VR. It's about a lesson in healthy skepticism.

Recent rise and falls of cryptocurrency, web3, NFTs, the metaverse [and more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX),
coupled with a current (real or perceived) economic slowdown, are teaching us all a new round of healthy skepticism
lessons. And that's just about things that actually exist -- it turns out, some things
[don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos).

Then there's a whole other realm of technologies that were potentially game-changing, but just ahead of their time. People
forget about [Ping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes_Ping), the "social network for music" from Apple. If you look
at Spotify today it fills much of that niche. (There are a laundry list of these that I won't go into, but instead will
ask the reader to prompt ChatGPT: "What's a list of software and hardware technologies that are now dead but were ahead
of their time?")

Speaking of ChatGPT: this appears to be a game-changing technology that's making us all forget about the web3 delirium
of the last few years. But... it remains to be seen whether it, too, will someday become pass√© that's so built into
everything we use that we take it for granted. Microsoft is integrating AI assistance into Office now in the ultimate
realization of the original intentions of Clippy.

That all being said, it is our job as technologists to perform technical exploration regardless of if a given
technology is going somewhere or not. The [decentralized identity](https://identity.foundation/) standards and
verifiable credentials technologies hold a lot of promise, some of which is starting to come to
[fruition](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedins-new-verification-features-include-clear-entra-rodriguez), and while I
personally believe these standards are part of our collective future, it's still early days.

No question about it, [I am ready to get hurt again](https://tvgag.com/gag/no-question-about-it/).
