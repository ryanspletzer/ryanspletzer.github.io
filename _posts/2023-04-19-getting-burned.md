The year was 2013, I was less than one year into my first job, and Google had just released
[Google Glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass).

This was no ordinary product release -- in order to get your hands on this elusive new piece of technology, you needed
to enter the "Glass Explorer" program, and fork out $1500 of cold, hard cash.

It was an interesting time for young technologists like myself. I and some other folks decided to do the crazy thing
and use some of that money from our hard-earned first paychecks towards this elusive piece of technology that was
promising to change the world.

It resulted in about two weeks of novelty and looking like a total dork, and the inception of a
[colorful term](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/30095/glasshole) to describe folks that went in on this.

Fast forward to the year 2023, and Google Glass in all its variations is now discontinued. I still have it in a drawer
somewhere to show to future generations. Maybe it will make the rounds at _Antiques Roadshow_ one day.

This entire experience taught me a really great lesson in healthy skepticism.

And we should have seen the warnings signs: you only need talk to some veteran technologists in the industry and
they will be quick to enlighten you about tales regarding [VRML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRML) and other early
attempts at VR, AR and overall XR.
