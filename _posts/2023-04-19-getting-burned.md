The year was 2013, I was less than one year into my first job post-college, and Google had just released
[Google Glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass).

This was no ordinary product release -- in order to get your hands on this elusive new piece of technology, you needed
to enter the "Glass Explorer" program, and fork out $1500 of cold, hard cash.

It was an interesting time for young technologists like myself. I and some other folks decided to do the crazy thing
and use some of that money from our hard-earned first paychecks towards this elusive piece of technology that was
promising to change the world.

It resulted in about two weeks of novelty and looking like a total dork, and the inception of a
[colorful term](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/30095/glasshole) to describe folks that went in on this.

Fast forward to the year 2023, and Google Glass in all its variations is now discontinued. I still have it in a drawer
somewhere to show to future generations. Maybe it will make the rounds at _Antiques Roadshow_ one day.

We should have seen the warnings signs: you only need talk to some veteran technologists in the industry and they will
be quick to enlighten you about tales regarding [VRML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRML) and other early attempts at
VR, AR and overall XR.

Because of this experience, to this day I do not own any type of VR headset, though I have tried out friend's setups.
There certainly is fun to be had there, and for niche things like air and space sims I can really see the appeal, but
is it essential to my everyday life? No... Beyond consumer, there are real enterprise applications for XR, thought I
may be biased on this front, working at a 3D design company.

(New form factors ultimately always present a challenge. I have this theory that the reason the iPad and tablets after
it did so well is because it resonates with existing form factors like [papyrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus)
and later paper and writing itself.)

This story is ultimately not about VR. It's about a lesson in healthy skepticism.

Recent rise and falls of cryptocurrency, web3, NFTs, the metaverse [and more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX) are
teaching us all a new round of healthy skepticism lessons. And that's just things that actually exist -- it turns out,
some things [don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos).

Then there's a whole other realm of technologies that were actually game-changing, but just ahead of their time. People
forget about [Ping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes_Ping), the "social network for music" from Apple. If you look
at Spotify today it fills much of that niche. (There are a laundry list of these that I won't go into, but instead will
ask the reader to prompt ChatGPT: "What's a list of software and hardware technologies that are now dead but were ahead
of their time?")

That all being said, it is our job as technologists to perform technical exploration regardless of if a given
technology is going somewhere or not.

No question about it, [I am ready to get hurt again](https://tvgag.com/gag/no-question-about-it/).
