# About

I'm Ryan Spletzer, a Software Developer in Information Research within R&D at Dow Chemical.

I've had experience in backend and frontend development, mostly in the .NET and ASP.NET stacks, and I am one of the biggest PowerShell fans you'll ever meet.

I'm currently neck-deep in DevOps and automating everything I can using tools like PowerShell DSC on Windows and Chef on Linux, both on-premises and in the Cloud.

I takes a craftsmanship approach to software and strive towards best design patterns and mastering the full stack, utilizing tools that enable automated release pipelines and continuous delivery.

## Open source

I enjoy working on and contributing to open source projects and would encourage anyone interested to peruse my [GitHub](https://github.com/ryanspletzer) account.

## Dow Chemical

Since graduating college from Michigan State University in 2012, I have worked at The Dow Chemical Company in Midland, Michigan.

In my current role as R&D Software Developer, I help to create research-driven applications and solutions in the Systems Development team in R&D. In addition to project work, I own and manages Team Foundation Server (TFS) for Information Research and collaborate with the Information Systems group on the enterprise Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) instance. I pursues driving improvements, usage of source control, automated builds and releases, and organizing work item tracking for the group. I also owns and manage Information Research's Web Farm, driving automation improvements with PowerShell DSC and implementing key architectural services like message queuing in Service Bus. Information Research is increasingly using Azure and as a result I'm currently managing Information Research's Azure Resources and created the logical organization of the resources we currently use.

In my first role in Dow's Information Systems department, I developed custom SharePoint and .NET solutions and applications as part of the Collaboration team. During this time I had the opportunity to worked on solutions and rollout of major implementations of SharePoint (FAST) Search 2010 and SharePoint Search 2013. I also helped to support and create branding solutions and tools for managing SharePoint 2013 upgrades in Office 365 Dedicated. While in the group, I got his first exposure to managing TFS when rolling out an Enterprise TFS 2012 instance, and this was also my first opportunity where he learned major architectural and software design patterns, and gained key concepts around Application Lifecycle Management.
