# About

I'm Ryan Spletzer, a Software and DevOps Engineer in Directory Services at
Autodesk.

I've had experience in backend and (some) frontend development, mostly in the
.NET and .NET Core stacks, and I am one of the biggest PowerShell fans you'll
ever meet.

## Open source

I enjoy working on and contributing to open source projects and would encourage
anyone interested to peruse my [GitHub](https://github.com/ryanspletzer)
account.

## Autodesk

In April of 2018, I joined Autodesk in Novi, Michigan, as part of the newly
formed Directory Services team.

The team is on a DevOps journey to automate and continuously improve Active
Directory, Azure AD and related services. This is being achieved with a
combination of CI/CD with VSTS, which deliver automations around these products
with Azure and AWS services, as well as with the development of new self-service
API's which increase developer productivty, and can be leveraged as an
integration platform by other products and systems.

## Dow Chemical

After graduating college from Michigan State University in 2012 with a degree in
Supply Chain Management and Minors in Computer Science and Information
Technology, I worked at The Dow Chemical Company in Midland, Michigan until
March 2018.

My last role at Dow was as an R&D Software Developer, where I helped to create
research-driven applications and solutions on the Information Research / Systems
Development team.

In addition to project work, I owned and managed our Team Foundation Server
(TFS) instance for Information Research and broader R&D, and collaborated with
our Information Systems group and co-administrated Dow's Enterprise Visual
Studio Team Services (VSTS) instance. I helped to drive improvements to our
processes, promote usage of source control (primarily Git), package management
and automated builds / releases, and helped to organize work item tracking in
the form of Scrum / Kanban boards for the group.

I also owned and managed Information Research's Web Farm, driving automation
improvements with PowerShell DSC and implementing key architectural services
like AMQP message queueing, worker services and scheduled batch jobs.

Dow began increasingly using Azure, and as a result I managed Information
Research's Azure subscription and created the logical organization and security
model of the resources we currently use, which other groups in the company
adopted as well.

In my first role in Dow's Information Systems department, I developed custom
SharePoint and .NET solutions and applications as part of the Collaboration
team. During this time I also had the opportunity work on the rollout of major
implementations of SharePoint (FAST) Search 2010 and SharePoint Search 2013. I
also helped to support and create branding solutions and tools for managing
SharePoint 2013 upgrades in Office 365 Dedicated. While in the group, I got my
first exposure to managing TFS when rolling out an Enterprise TFS 2012 instance.
This role was also where I first learned major architectural and software
design patterns and gained key concepts around Application Lifecycle Management.
