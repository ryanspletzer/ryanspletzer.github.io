I'm a Distinguished Software Engineer at [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com). I try my best to blog here as well as
post my thoughts to [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanspletzer/),
[BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/ryan.spletzer.com), and [Mastodon](https://spletzer.com/@ryan). I dabble and aspire
to do more open-source side projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/ryanspletzer) whenever I find this elusive thing
called "free time."

## Bio

I received a bachelor's degree in Supply Chain Management along with minors in Computer Science and Information
Technology from Michigan State University in 2012, and I will be forever kicking myself and living with imposter
syndrome for having not gotten a full degree in Computer Science.

I was a software engineer at Dow Chemical from 2012 to 2014 in Information Systems working on SharePoint development
and from 2014 to 2018 in R&D working on applications for research and running our source control and CI/CD environments
(Git with TFS / Azure DevOps) and managing our cloud Azure environment, amongst other things. This is where I learned to
love PowerShell.

In 2018 I joined Autodesk as a software engineer on the newly formed Directory Services team to automate infrastructure
in AWS and Azure and create automation and self-service for employees around all things Active Directory and Azure AD
and Identity and Access Management. Since then our team has grown in scope to include Collaboration and Network
automation use cases and work on FedRAMP compliance initiatives as well as involvement in Autodesk's internal delivery
platforms and open-source initiatives.

As we speak I am currently getting deep on data and working on AI solutions as part of Autodesk's Enterprise AI team.
